          Reddot winner 2024 - the AI pin by 
          <a href="https://humane.com/">Humane</a>
          <br>
          <p><strong>HP actually acquired Humane's AI capabilities as of February 2025</strong> for their own emerging experiments,
         it's a good artifact for considering, but the AI pin is in fact no more.
         </p>

          It has 
          <em>most</em>
          functions of a phone - call, text, photos videos, music - no additional apps really. 
          But this crafted - <strong>hands free</strong> - interface interaction 
        along with integrated AI and camera use is what makes it especially unique and appealing.</p>

        It can be magnetically pinned to your clothing and is 
          mainly facilitated vocally
           using your AI assistant - supported in at least 48 languages - 
         allowing special functions that go beyond most phones capabilities.</p>

        <p>It has a touchpad for manual controls such as answering calls, maneuvering music tracks, and volume.</p>

        <p>It also has a laser ink display for specific instances where you may need a interface to interact with-
          you just have to lift your hand in front of your pin for it to project onto.

        <p>Their ethos, though, is to avoid addictive interfaces, to get back to physical world and only
          use UI when you need it.
        </p>
        
        <p>The voice and camera controls and are similar to the 
          <a href="/glasses">Meta Ray-Bans glasses</a>
          , you can ask your AI to 
          look at what you're looking at, and do specific commands such as translating something your looking at.

        <p>Their site gives great examples of the use cases for the assistant, but, as the user, it's a bit hard
          to keep track of them and what the capabilities are. In plain terms, it's confusing to 
          even think of what to ask or request. 
        </p>
        <p>So is this most effectively a sexier GoPro x Apple Watch?</p>
