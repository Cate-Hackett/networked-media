          "The MinVerse, developed by Haply Robotics, introduces a level of
          tactile interaction that redefines digital creation."" 
          </p>
          <p>
          "Instead of
          passively gliding through surfaces, it reacts to the virtual world,
          pushing back when encountering solid surfaces, offering the sensation
          of weight, and making digital objects feel real."

        <p>
          "Sculpting in 3D suddenly felt natural, as if I was actually pushing
          clay rather than manipulating polygons. Controlling objects felt
          precise, like my hands were directly influencing on-screen physics."
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>It can integrate with tools like Blender and Unity. </p>

        <p>"About the size of a large power-bank, the MinVerse sits at just 40mm 
          or 1.5 inches in height, with the ability to be used on its own, attached 
          to a computer mouse, or even a stylus – effectively revolutionizing fields
          like design, engineering, creative coding, game development, and even gaming itself."</p>
          <p>The MinVerse seems both technical, accessible, AND consumer grade. </p>

        <p>Are these use cases niche but effective? Is this just for makers and gamers? 
          Is there a future for this product to expand on
          interaction with general and everyday digital interfaces?
