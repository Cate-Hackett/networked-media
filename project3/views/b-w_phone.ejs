        <h2>Black and White Phone</h2>

          E ink is having a small come back. This black and white phone by 
          <a href="https://minimalcompany.com/">minimal company</a>
          is a dream for the digital minimalist.
        </p>
        <p>Its e ink display reduces eye strain and has a physical QWERTY keyboard - some features that really appeal
          to physical / analog lovers. Yep, it's even got a headphone jack again. </p>
        <br>

        <br />
        <p>Ironic that Steve Jobs was proud to get rid of the mobile keyboard, since "you don't always need em"!
          And here it is back?!
        </p>
        <p>The phone features the Google Play store and allows you to download any apps you need, all while 
          emphasizing minimalism and only core features you need. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Minimal company's mission is for phones
          to simply be the tools they need to be, we don't need all that flashy stuff like color, do we?
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>Don't worry, you're not buying an e-reader though, it still includes most "high tech" aspects of 
          smartphones we look for, it has fingerprint unlock on the power button (novel right?), camera and flash...
        </p>

        <br>
       <p>Is this a glorious balance of high tech and low tech? Or 
        <em>just</em>
         low tech?</p>
        <p>This seems like a good combat to phone addiction, and $400 for pre-order isn't too bad - considered me persuaded?! 
          Worth a try?
        </p>
